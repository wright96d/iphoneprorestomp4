For when you're insane enough to record ProRes video on an iPhone but not insane enough to have a 1tb iCloud account. Created to allow for local backup of ProRes originals and more manageable iPhone/iCloud copies. But could obviously be used to just reencode and delete the ProRes originals. Could probably all be done with ffmpeg I guess, but where's the fun in that?
